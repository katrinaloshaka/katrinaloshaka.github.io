                This project was very fun. But I faced some difficulties. Fow exapmle in the begining of this porject we had to be divded into pairs and we were standing in the line from least "code friendly" to most. And I was in the group with a person who knew how to code as much as I did- almost 0. ;D
                <br>
                We were using inspector and trying to understand how does the exaple page work, and with time we actually started getting results, and that was the best feeling ever!
                <br> JavaScript is not my srong side still, but that was a good practice and proof that we can do it if we really want it.
