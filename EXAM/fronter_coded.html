                This was a big challenge for me, as I am not a big coder, I was struggling with media queries and fitting everything properly in the screen. I wanted to make it as similar as possible.

                We accsepted a challenge of coding a chat. In the prototype you can see the chat function has all the functions that regular chat has.<br> We weren't thaught how to code a chat, therefore in reality it did not go as smooth as in the prototype. <br> I ended up coding just the layout and doing the design of the chat room, and unfortunatelly you cannot use it as a real chat.
