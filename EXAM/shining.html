                So this is the "finished" project of The Shining interactive game. As our group memeber fell sick and went to the hospital, we kind of rushed the process and you can still see that the game is gliching and is definetelly now ferfect. 
                <br>
                I learned from this expierience that I always have to have a Plan B. I cannot rely on other team members, I always need to be prepared for the worst.  
                <br>
                Also in the picture you can see the yellow and blue circle floating randomly around, They had to be the door nobs, but as we were sturggling with css animation, they now are just around the place, but still workig.
